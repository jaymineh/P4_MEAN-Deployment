**MEAN Stack Deployment**
---

In this Project, I created a simple Book register app using Javascript and deployed it to a MEAN webstack. The frontend was done with AngularJS, the backend with ExpressJS, the database was set up using MongoDB (unstructured database) and Node.js was used to setup the runtime environment for displaying results to the end user.

This is a project where I deployed a MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & NodeJS) web stack.

Kindly check `project.md` for more info.
